            <div class="tab-pane overflow" id="newbie" role="tabpanel">
              <h3 class="posthead">Newbie Information and tips</h3>
              <ul class="list">
              <li>If you never been to Dreamhack here's some good tips from a veteran to make your first event go smoothly!</<li>>
              <li>Always be on time! If you're gonna be late for some reason please inform your group leader.</li>
              <li>We will have a meeting with general information the day before the event around 18:00 CET. Here we will talk about positions and go through basics for newbies, so if you're new don't miss this. We generally don't want to spend our free time to repeat ourselves.</li>
              <li>Your team position isn't set in stone! If you have a valid reason to switch please tell your group leader and they will talk to the team leader about a switch.</li>
              <li>Our team has a dress code when we work: Black/orange crew shirt and black pants. This is because we work closely with the production crew and we want to be seen as little as possible while they're filming. We will supply you with an orange or black crew shirt to work in but you will have to supply the rest yourself. </li>
              <li>Bring good shoes and a decent thing (air mattress or something to that extent) to sleep on. Hurting feet and lack of sleep really does a number on you after 3 days+!</li>
              <li>Please change your clothes and shower. There's showers in the D-hall for crew members only. We work closely with people and nobody enjoys a stinky person. This means that it's recommended to bring shampoo/soap/deodorant and similar items for hygiene.</li>
              <li>We will have a private room for Esport security where you can set up a computer for gaming on your free time. As of DHS 2017 it will be located in the B-hall. If you bring a computer don't forget to bring a network cable and a power strip. </li>
              <li>It's surprisingly hard to find a power outlet to charge your phone/3DS or whatever kids use nowadays. If you have an USB powerbank you should bring it!</li>
              <li>Dreamhack is a drug and alcohol free event. This means that you can get thrown out if you're not sober. Please do us all a favor and leave those things at home under the event.</li>
              <li>If you have no idea what to do when you get to the event and you need assistance finding the crew corner or need assistance finding a place to sleep, just contact a team leader or a group leader (phone numbers listed in the google sheets document posted in the private Facebook group)</li>
              <li>DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS! We were all new once and without a friend to assist you it's not easy figuring out where everything is and what everybody does so if we forgot to mention something just ask!</li>
